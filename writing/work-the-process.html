I had a thermodynamics professor in college who took one of the first days of class to teach us the 12 step problem solving process he insisted we use on every assignment and exam.

Thanks to my wife, I was able to recreate what the steps were:

<blockquote>

  On a piece of engineering paper, write the following things in numbered sections:
  <ol>
    <li>Your name</li>
    <li>The full problem statement</li>
    <li>The 'given' facts</li>
    <li>What you've been asked to find</li>
    <li>The thermodynamic system involved</li>
    <li>The physical system involved</li>
    <li>The fundamental equations you will use</li>
    <li>The assumptions you are making</li>
    <li>The type of process involved</li>
    <li>Your working equations</li>
    <li>Physical properties or constants</li>
    <li>The solution</li>
    </ol>
    
    </blockquote>
    
    A majority of the credit came from steps 1-11; the answer mattered, but less than whether you "worked the process". This wasn't some attempt at grade inflation or to make people feel like they were still winners even if they got the answer wrong, it was because of a genuine belief that working a defined process in engineering was the path to long-term success. If you can set up the basics correctly - identifying the problem, clarifying what you know and what assumption you are making, etc. - you will more likely than not be able to get the right answer.
    
    Throughout the course, when asked a question, our professor would challenge the questioner to "work the process" as far as they could. Inevitably, the answer would reveal itself.
    
    More and more over the years since that class, I've come to realize that working the process applies in any context of life or business where you're facing what looks to be a difficult problem:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Want to improve your marketing site performance? Work the process of designing, running, and analyzing a sequence of experiments, and chances are you'll end up improving performance.</li>
      <li>Trying to tackle a difficult feature (and believe in TDD)? Figure out what you want it to do, write some failing tests, make the tests pass, and before you know it you'll have finished the detailed feature.</li>
      <li>Want to lose weight? Work the process of figuring out how many calories you take in and how many calories you expend, and adjust one or both of those to create a deficit, and you'll lose weight.</li>
      
      </ul></li></li></li></ul></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol></blockquote>:
